Say I want to get the latest news and video clips on Ron Wyden or Kirsten Gillibrand - what's the best way to query and then view/read/watch that? Seems like all of the bot work you've been doing could be a good interface for interacting with this data set...\n",

Since you have just used the YouTube API, we thought you could have a look at the [YouTube AI recommender.](https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/09/How-YouTube-Recommendation-Works) There have been a few examples analyzing how the AI recommender system works. \n",
