    "**IPyton or Jupyter Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have mentioned, in this class our main language for computation will be [Python](http://www.python.org). It was chosen because of its emphasis on **readability and code sharing.** These and other desirable aspects of the language have helped attract a large community of users who have contributed an incredible range of capabilities to the language. Community-written code will let us pull data from web pages and PDFs, it will let us manipulate tweets and other posts from social media, and will even give us the capacity to anaylyze images and sound. *The more we see of the world as data, as open to computation in some way, our reporting skills expand and our stories become deeper.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We will program in Python (assemble Python expressions) using the Jupyter notebook -- the name \"Jupyter\" being a mix [Julia](http://julialang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the three languages it originally supported. Programming with the notebook is often referred to as \"literate computing\" -- by that we mean that you code a little, have a look, write a little, come up with more ideas, code a little more, write a little more and so on. To support this, there are two kinds of \"cells\" that one can either write or program in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The writing is done in **Markdown cells**. Markdown (as opposed to Mark-up) is a language that lets you write in a plain text editor (in this simplest cases the Notepad or TextEdit would work fine too) and there are simple typographical shorthands to **make text bold** or *to put text in italics*. You can also make lists like\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Bread\n",
    "+ Milk\n",
    "+ Dog food\n",
    "+ Swiffer pads\n",
    "\n",
    "These Markdown conventions are then translated into HTML -- the upshot being that you don't have to know anything about HTML to create documents that look reasonably good, certainly good enough for your reporting notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Double click in this window to see the \"raw\" Markdown. Notice that you can still recognize lists and emphasized text from the Markdown additions, and that's the other point of this. Your documents, while written in plain text, make use of typographical conventions that make the document's highlighting understandable even without translation to HTML. That's a good trick! \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find [the Markdown description here.](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Don't forget that for our last class, you were expected to have gone through the [Markdown Tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com). There might be other learning resources that we should share with the class, so let us know if you find something really helpful!\n",

    "One last note. Many organizations (scientific research labs, journalistic organizations, and so on) are \"publishing\" dual works -- one that goes into an official journal like Science or The New York Times summarizing a set of computations, and then another that is published in the form of a notebook that documents the author's computational work. Here are some examples from science and journalism.\n",

    "\n",
    "You get the idea. There are an increasing number of projects like this -- the fact that you can take someone else's notebook and examine the steps they followed to arrive at their conclusions is, ultimately, an important step toward transparency in data or computational journalism. The notebooks become objects of coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction to Python: Some basic data types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we code using a notebook or some other interface, our basic language will be Python. As we mentioned in class, Python is an **object-oriented language**. Software objects are a kind of programming abstraction, a particular way of organizing information and actions. Software objects try to mimic the notion of objects in the physical world -- that means they contain properties or **data** and also might have certain operations or **methods** that you can use to transform the object in some way. We used the example of one of our lovely purple rolling chairs -- it has operations (it can support you when you sit, it has a foldable arm for writing, and it can move around the room) as well as \"data\" (it has a seat height, a desk height, maybe even an RGB value specifying the lovely purple color).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a series of built-in types of objects, meaning certain types of information that are so basic that they are needed by just about every programming exercise you'll attempt. What might those be?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, some of the basic or built-in types of objects are really really basic like numbers (counting numbers or, more generally, integers, like 2, 5 and -3; as well as \"real\" numbers, those having a decimal point, like 5.67) and text strings (sequences of characters like \"Is he really going to make us read Trump's Tweets?\"). These data have *types* 'int' and 'float' and 'str' respectively. You can tell the type of any object in Python with a built-in function type(). Yes, some operations are so common or basic that they are also \"built-in\" as *functions*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lines below, we create strings (objects of type 'str') by surrounding some text with quotation marks. They can be double, single (or even triple double quotes) and Python doesn't care which as long as they match at the beginning and the end of the string. The built-in statement \"print\" will, well, print whatever follows it where we can print groups of things by separating them with commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For the record, we're now about to see three built-in types -- integers, real or floating point numbers, and strings -- a built-in function, type(), and a built-in statement, print. And it's only our first few cells of code!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, we look at a sequence of charactrers that constitute a string."

A computer can't deal with never-ending things and has to make compromises.
