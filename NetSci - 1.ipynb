Similarly, the links might be friendships, alliances, reactions, synapses, optical and copper cables, URLs, or citations. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. *Cascading Effects* : A complex system posses the ability to send ripple effects due to strong coupling among its components. Failures or collapses can lead to cascading failures. \n",
    "2. *Nested layers* : Components about complex systems can themselves be complex. Think about economies, they are made up of organizations, which are made up of people and unions.\n",
    "3. *Emergent Phenomena* : While the results/ purpose of the individual or basic components may be analyzed separately, there are key systems properties that are only visible on a higher level of analysis. One interesting example of this is [Starlings murmurations](https://www.wired.com/2011/11/starling-flock/). Another example is how [hurricanes evolve](http://www.evolutionofcomputing.org/Multicellular/Emergence.html). "

In other words, most nodes are not neighbors of one another, but the neighbors of any given node are likely to be neighbors of each other and most nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops or steps. Thus, nodes are highly clustered. \n",

This theory also proposes there are a very small proportion of  highly connected neurons (hubs), which have connections spanning much  longer distances.
