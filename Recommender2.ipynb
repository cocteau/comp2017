    "This was pretty straightforward (I hope). The techniques here are referred to ask \"k-nearest neighbors\" (or KNN or kNN). It's actually a pretty powerful machine learning (well, statistical) technique. And we leverage this kind of scheme all the time -- your doctor, for example, distills \"you\" into a row in a table, a height, a weight, a blood pressure, maybe some facts from your medical history. She then gives you advice about dropping a few pounds, say by what the medical profession knows about people like you. The idea is that the health outcomes of people \"similar\" to you can help predict what's around the corner for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key ideas here are pretty fundamental and **they have to do with distance.** Rows, for example, can be compared. In the case of collaborative filtering, we can evaluate one recipe relative to another, marking some as close (similar ingredients) and others as far (different tastes). This is a basic, mathematical abstraction that machine learning applies to all tables. Rows are points in a \"high-dimensional space\". (The same is true for columns, of course, except that it's typical to have tables -- spreadsheets-- organized so that rows refer to units of observation and columns refer to their characteristics.)\n",
