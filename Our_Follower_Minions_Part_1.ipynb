Bot affinity? Maybe real people following along? How did they find us?)

To give you a taste, using the site [SpyOnWeb](http://www.spyonweb.com/) (suggested in Alexander's blog post), we can \"easily disclose websites with the same ip address, advertising and statistic codes.\" So, starting with devumi.com, we find it's site kin. [Have a look.](http://www.spyonweb.com/devumi.com) You see competing Twitter bot sites as well as other  review sites sharing Google Analytics IDs -- the same organizataion is monitoring traffic across this group of sites, suggesting a connection. This is a detour, but we wanted to give you a sense that networks live throughout the technologies we are examining for this class."
