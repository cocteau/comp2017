    "In class we started to flesh out your ideas for a trending algorithm. We have a lot of data, code and new vocabulary to make this real! Keep in mind that you can propose anything you like. From a brand new algorithm to one that \"polishes up\" Twitter's, to anything else. You can rely on the data we have provided or collect your own. Please answer the following questions and get ready to start implementing on Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Based on your work last night, let's start by putting your idea of trending into words. **What does it mean for a topic to trend on Twitter?** Does it have to do with popularity? Does it have to do with timeliness? Is there some measure of importance you want to add? What about how influential people are who are promoting the topic? This is your \"model of the world\" that your trending algorithm will, in turn, be an argument for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. And what constitutes a topic? Is it user's mentioned? Hashtags? Particular news articles (URLs)? Words used in tweets that are not one of these kinds of entities? Words used in linked material?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why have you chosen this particular approach? Is there a journalistic principle you're applying? What makes this sensible?\n",
    "4. Keep an eye on how your algorithm might be gamed. Don't imagine an all powerful robot, but could someone with minimal skills boost something to trending that you think shouldn't be? How is your algorithm protected?"
