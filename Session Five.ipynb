    "![Bot](http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/02/04/trumpbot_51_wide-99a6d194a30546394eff755db56b8579745e5921-s800-c85.png \"Bot\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started with the Twitter API and detecting bots, let's take a look at [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "Most APIs are built on top of a simple protocol called HTTP. HTTP powers most of the communications on the web, including your browser and probably most of the apps that you use. HTTP allows you (via your browser, a mobile app or even code you write!) to **request** data (HTML, PDFs, MP3s, etc) from a service across the internets (e.g. google.com, twitter.com) and that service will respond with the requested data (i.e. the **response**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how HTTP (and the Internet) works in more detail...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API, or application programming interface, allows you to specify the data you want and returns it in a computer-friendly format like JSON or XML. The \"interface\"  is a regularized way to make requests, and a consistent specification for the data you asked for. So many organizations now publish APIs for their data. From [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to [ProPublica](https://propublica.github.io/campaign-finance-api-docs/), to governmental organizations like the [EPA](https://developer.epa.gov/category/api/), to social media sites like [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) and [LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Most API providers require you as the developer to use a form of authentication while using their APIs. There are various forms of authentication: oauth, api keys and even username and passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, like [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/) only require that you use an API key when making API calls. With API keys, you usually just pass the key in your API calls, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json?api_key=abcxyz&q=tesla\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) is a bit more complicated but provides more fine-grained control for the API service as well as the users. Let's come back to it right after we set up our Twitter API keys (yep, they use OAuth for their API authentication).\n"

    "## Using The Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the Twitter API, we need to register an \"application\" (um, an \"app\"!) that will be pulling data from their service. This means that in one sweet instant you have become a developer! 😮 The steps are pretty easy and listed below. You'll first need to get a set of \"keys\" to drive this bad boy and then install a Python library that exposes the Twitter API through special objects. \n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "If you don't already have credentials for Twitter, you have to create an application and generate a set of keys (an API key, API secret, Access token and Access token secret) on the Twitter developer site. There are five easy steps!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Twitter user account if you do not already have one.\n",
    "2. Go to [https://apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) and log in with your Twitter user account. This step gives you a Twitter developer's account under the same name as your user account. (Um, and congratulations! You're now a developer!)\n",
    "3. Click “Create New App”\n",
    "4. Fill out the form, agree to the terms, and click “Create your Twitter application”\n",
    "5. In the next page, click on “Keys and Access Tokens” tab, and copy your “API key” and “API secret”. Scroll down and click “Create my access token”, and copy your “Access token” and “Access token secret”.\n",

By \"help\" we mean they have created objects that hide the details of making requests for data from Twitter, and leave you with a clean coding interface. Your requests to Twitter are in the form of neat methods (verbs) that return data on users, their statuses and followers. You can even post tweets using these libraries.\n",
