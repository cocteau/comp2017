    "Computational journalism: Hacking your attention\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the term *computational journalism.* What does it mean for journalism to be computational? Over the last few decades, computers have become part of our everyday lives. They regulate and shape our interactions with the physical and virtual worlds. Organizations increasingly equate (though not without problems) \"data release\" with transparency. Sensing (sound, light, air quality) is cheap and plentiful, and easily deployed by the general public. Our actions online generate vast quantities of digital data. In all of this, we can find new ways to ask questions about the world, how it's organized and how it functions. But the keys to this new digitized kingdom are data, code and algorithms. The curiosity, the questioning spirit, you developed last semester in your reporting classes, finds an outlet in new and unexpected ways, mediated by data, code and algorithms. Hence, *computational journalism.* It is simply a response to our new condition of living in a computational society.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this year's edition of the course, we will be focusing on computational tools and techniques that, while not necessarily new, certainly achieved new prominence in the recent national election. The vast networks of information that are created every day are simply too large for us to examine in their entirety. To get a sense of \"what's on,\" we take feeds from algorithmic recommender systems, we scan trending topics, we focus on information shared with us by our friends or people we trust. Over the last few years, we have seen how these tools and strategies for directing our attention can be hacked. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the theme of our course. It is broad, admitedly, but we will be creating projects and stories that look at how we receive information. Here is a list of topics that your instructors have come up with -- we invite you to add to or edit this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Search.* We will look at search engines, their design and function. We will both look at the \"autocomplete\" features as well as the returned lists of search results. We will examine what it takes to influence these algorithms and assess their frailties (promoting, say, \"filter bubbles\"). We will read alternative designs for search engines, designs that emphasize enriching political discourse -- as well as clicktroughs. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Trending topics.* How do different organizations identify currently popular topics? What's being discussed right now? We will compare Facebook and Twitter, assembling large data sets and providing you with both an opportunity to question how well existing algorithms function as well as build something different.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Algorithmic recommender systems.* Distinct from trending topics, here we look newsfeed analysis. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Fake news.* This term needs to be retired, but the concept lets us discuss the Fake News AI (artificial intelligence) challenge, network analyses to see how a fake news story goes viral on Twitter, and even have a wiff of \"bots\" to see the role that fake Twitter accounts might be playing in material going viral. We will implement \"Hoaxy\" and the underlying tools that classify a Twitter account as fake. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Network analysis.* We introduce and build tools for looking at networks that are activated by certain kinds of material when shared on Twitter. We will buy 10,000 followers and examine how many are bots and how they behave. We will also look at networks of news sites that are all under the control of a single authority. How do you spot the depencence and then graph the networks? \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Bots and botnets.* From conversational bots (deployed by the Clinton and Trump campaigns, for example), to bots that harass, to bots that \"join in\" and help spread content on a social network, to \"Google bombs\", we will examine how autonomous programs can be used to hack our attention.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Adtech.* We will begind with Facebooks's targeting abilities and then look at Google Ads and Facebook advertising as vehicles for fake news, for spreading viral content. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Explainable AI.* How can we make predictions, algorithms, more understandable? \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Hacking stories.* Or, rather, stories of our hacked attention. Here we mean stories like the Lotan piece you read for today. What goes into crafting a story like this?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn a variety of tools along the way, and our primary programming language will be Python. We will talk through how we came to this decision, but for the moment, know that it is a flexible language that lets you easily connect to networks like Twitter, assemble and analyze data from formal databases and the web, and build responsive services based on all these inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python from within this notebook framework. The notebook is an ideal way to address you journalistic and programming needs. Beyond simply commenting on what\n",
    "your code is doing, these notebooks are a legitimate authoring system that you will use\n",
    "to create (and publish) pitches and memos for this class. "

    "**Why we code**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this course is to introduce computation, broadly defined, as a tool for both finding and telling stories. This mean \"reporting on\" computation and its role in the world, as well as \"reporting with\" computing tools in pursuit of a story -- and any combination of the two.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When teaching computation (or any \"technology\") as part of a course, people often refer to \"literacy\" as a goal. For the most part, that term implies \"functional literacy\" -- do you understand how to use something? Can you write a program, say, to assemble a data set from the web? Stuart Selber, a professor of English at Penn State, writes about two other facets to being literate. After functional literacy, he defines \"critical literacy.\" Here are characteristics of a critically literate student.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Design cultures.* A critically literate student scrutinizes the dominant perspectives that shape computer design cultures and their artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Use contexts.* A critically literate student sees use contexts as an inseperable aspect of computers that helps to contextualize and constitute them.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Institutional forces.* A critically literate student understands the institutional forces that shape computer use.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Popular representations.* A critically literate student scrutinizes representations of \n",
    "computers in the public imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third kind of literacy is \"rhetorical.\" \n",
    "\n",
    ">*Persuasion.* A rhetorically literate student understands that persuasion permeates interface design contexts in both implicit and explicit ways and that it always involves larger structures and forces (e.g., use contexts, ideology).\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Deliberation.* A rhetorically literate student understands that interface design problems are ill-defined problems whose solutions are representational arguments that have been arrived at through various deliberative activities.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Reflection.* A rhetorically literate student articulates his or her interface design knowledge at a conscious level and subjects their actions and practices to critical assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Social action.* A rhetorically literate student sees interface design as a form of social versus technical action.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the standpoint of a journalism student, all of this might best be wrapped up in the following equivalences (shamelessly cribbed from Ian Bogost at Georgia Tech).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<center>**Digital Technology = Model of the World  = Argument**</center>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In short, every piece of digital technology embeds within it a model of the world. You might think of this as the dominant \"use case\" a designer had in mind. The net effect is that some actions are natural, \"designed for\", easy, while others are hard. And this is the argument. It is the way that technology trains you to adopt its conventions, its embedded model of the world. You are led to do the easy things and avoid the hard things. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will spend a great deal of time learning a programming language, Python. And yes, any given coding language has its own model of the world and makes its own arguments for certain kinds of practices (certain metaphors for actually writing code). But with a coding language comes almost unbounded flexibility to create. Unlike many of the designed systems we interact with, coding gives us the freedom to build, to imagine the world in new ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these ideas take on particular resonance with our theme, \"Hacking your attention.\" We are inviting you to not only investigate existing algorithms for computing \"trending topics,\" but also to try out your own ideas about how this should be done. In an age when people are arguing for \"algorithmic accountability\" and \"explainable\" artificial intelligence\", it's the perfect time to consider a reporting practice that investigates by building.

    ">**Suman Deb Roy** *is the Lead Data Scientist at betaworks, a technology company that operates as a studio - building new products, growing companies and seed investing. Previously, he worked with Microsoft Research and as a Fellow at the Missouri School of Journalism. He is responsible for building several data products at Digg, Instapaper and Poncho. Suman is also the author of 'Social Multimedia Signals: A Signal Processing Approach to Social Network Phenomena' - a book that describes theories, algorithms and best practices to intelligently learn from Web Media. *\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Dr. Roy’s work in transfer (machine) learning won the IEEE Communications Society MMTC Best Journal Paper Award in 2015 and his research on media analysis with algorithms has been covered in The NY Times, Bloomberg News, The Atlantic, The Economist, CJR, Huffington Post and Harvard. He was invited to speak about the same at various conferences and institutions, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Knight Foundation, Amazon, O’Reilly Media etc. His current research focuses on verification of algorithmic systems in real world applications, designing natural language interfaces in voice/ chat bots and the prospective use of AI in media literacy.* \n",
    "\n",
    "The second is Mike Young. As you will see, both Mike and Suman have extensive experience developing journalistic technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Michael Young** *is the CTO of Digg.com. Before working for Digg, he was CTO/co-founder of a Betaworks-funded personalized news service called News.me. A few years after starting News.me, betaworks acquired Digg, at which time Michael and his News.me team transitioned into the group that would rebuild Digg. Prior to that, he was the lead Creative Technologist in the NYTimes R&D Lab. At the NYTimes R&D lab, Michael led a group charged with prototyping new ways of consuming media across mobile, web, tv and other connected devices (cars, etc). During his time there, he authored two books, won the Yahoo! BBC London Hack Day, received a patent for \"Method and System for Providing Preference Based Content to a Location Aware Mobile Device\" and was awarded a Knight-Batten Award for Innovations in Journalism. Michael has a degree in Computer Science and Math from Lewis & Clark College in Portland, OR.*"

Python now has a considerable development community and you can find important resources at the [Python web site.](https://www.python.org/) According to that site, Python is \"a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Those problems include  string manipuation -- looking at the words or sentences in a document, say. Python is conversant in network protocols which means you can use it to access web sites and services -- this will help with web scraping or pulling data from Twitter. There are add-ons contributed by the community that let you make wonderful maps and data visualizations, perform analysis on tabular data (but not in a wonky Excel fashion), and access data stored in a variety of different databases. \n",

    ">In the dark ages, only those with power or great wealth (and selected experts) possessed reading and writing skills or the ability to acquire them.
