    "Regular Expressions\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this portion of class, we are going to work with a \"language\" for expressing patterns in text. By \"pattern\" I mean specifying repetitions of symbols -- words or punctuation or sequences of numbers or any combination of these. Given a collection of text, for example, regular expressions might help you find dates or telephone numbers or URLs or email addresses -- all of these obey certain formatting rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, then, are a way to describe these formatting rules so that we can search a body of text for them. Sometimes we are doing this because we want to find lists of facts about people (email addresses and their telephone numbers, say), creating structured data out of unstructured data (a common theme in this class). And sometimes we appeal to regular expressions because they help us in the act of \"cleaning\" data -- we might be given a date column in a data set that contains dates in two different formats (y-m-d and m/d/y, say) and we need to transform them into just one consistent format throughout. \n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns we express might also be about content. Can we detect the gender of sources? Can we find new memes in a stack of text? Unlike the proto-natural language processing we saw with TextBlob, regular expressions deal with words as patterns of characters. There is no understanding here about parts of speech or grammar. Just patterns of symbols -- characters, numbers, and emoji, even.\n",

    "**Trump's Press Conference**\n",

With a new medium, comes newer opportunities to experiment with news delivery, and newer metrics to judge performance with. \n",

    "\n",
    "A new paradigm is ushered because there were inefficiencies in the previous paradigm, either present in the design or caused by evolutionary usage. Lets start with that 1980s supercomputer in your pocket- the smartphone. Think about the apps on your phone. You can launch every app independenlty. But there are also digital assistants trying to become a central intelligene in your phone, through which you communicate with some of the apps. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Facebook’s M, Google Now and Microsoft’s Cortana all provide a single interface to control specific app capabilities. However, none of them allow us to do anything drastically advanced other than reducing the number of taps we make on a phone.\n",

It may be only a matter of time until conversational agents invade consumer markets. There is [growing anticipation](http://observer.com/2016/01/2016-will-be-the-year-of-conversational-commerce/) because stats around user interactions with chat bots vs. app usage is incredible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the AppStore and Google Play host over 1.5 M apps each. Yet *on average, the number of apps downloaded by a person in the US every month is zero*. It seems like another paradigm shift is happening - the onset of messaging. Here are four main indicators that messaging is making apps irrelevant: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. App download slows considerably: \n",
    "    - Apps aren’t dying. But the entire space is collapsing, just like so many other industries before it. Its too crowded now, too hard to break in, numerous forced taps just for on-boarding and countless separate interfaces to keep track. Apps come with their own friction components — walled gardens, sign-up drags, untimely push notifications and re-installs. Both app makers and app users are getting increasingly frustrated with the ecosystem.\n",
    "    - App transition is costly. As a panacea, bots within WeChat enable its 600m monthly users to book taxis, or check in for flights, or buy cinema tickets, or manage banking and reserve doctors’ appointments without ever leaving the app. \n",
    "2. User Retention is poor: \n",
    "    - It is incredibly hard to make an app and keep people interested or engaged. On average, the Daily Average Users of an app drops to 77% within the first 3 days, and by a stunning 95% in first 3 months. \n",
    "3. Artificial Intelligence is improving: \n",
    "    - There are many things happening in the AI space, in the subfields of computer vision, natural language processing, algorithmic art, speech recognition etc. The field most applicable to bots is natural language understanding. \n",
    "    - Current state of bot intelligence is somewhat of an ugly marriage of bits of AI which kind of works and lots of hand coding ([but this can change soon, yes scientists are on it](http://www.wildml.com/2016/04/deep-learning-for-chatbots-part-1-introduction/)).

    "But today we will be talking about conversational bots. Language holds the weight of the human condition. Epistemically, there are two key reasons we converse. One originates from the fact that we consider time valuable, and the second originates from the fact that we want to be part of a community. \n",
    "- First, conversation demands a relatively equal exchange of information. What happens when there isn't a relatively equal exchange - can you think of terms we use for such \"talk\". \n",
    "- Second, since the early days of humanity, building social ties have been a critical factor in explaining behavior. Conversation is a natural way to \"bond\" and transfer knowledge. And thus humans have a natural urge to converse.. even if its with an artificial entity. For example, the mother of all bots and one of the first bots that millions of users ever interacted with was called [\"SmarterChild\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmarterChild), which lived on AOL and Windows/MSN messengers. Think of it as the precursor to Siri. \n"

    "- **Xiaoice**\n",
    "    - [Xiaoice](http://nautil.us/issue/33/attraction/your-next-new-best-friend-might-be-a-robot) is a chat bot developed by Microsoft Research Asia. It lives within apps like Line, WeChat and Weibo and boasts a user base of over 40 million, most of who spend hours chatting with it. In truth, labeling Xiaoice as an virtual assistant is an understatement. Xiaoice can comment if you’ve had a haircut. She can suggest products to purchase based on your conversations. She will respond angrily if you antagonize her. She is emotional, talkative, friendly and personal — in addition to supporting the usual transactional applications any user would demand. She is the 6th-most active celebrity on a platform that boasts 198 monthly active users; 25% of whom have said ‘I love you’ to her. \n",

Chatbots are really a conversation-based interfaces to services of various kinds. As you have seen, sometimes the logic behind their inner workings is incredibly complex, but other times their operation is very service-oriented and shallow. \n",

    "The FastCompany article makes the point that while strands of artificial intelligence research has been obsessed with making a both that was believably human (or perhaps with the potential for one), the latest incarnations of these programs exist \"to help you get things done.\" They have grown plentiful using the scale of new platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and so on) and are fit tidily into their business interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    ">But over the past few years, chatbots have made a comeback. With advancements in processing power, bots now have a better ability to interpret natural language and learn from users over time. Just as importantly, big companies like Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are now eager to host our interactions with various services, and offer tools for developers to make those services available. Chatbots easily fit into their larger business models of advertising, e-commerce, online services, and device sales. Meanwhile, services that want to reach hundreds of millions of customers on a platform like Messenger will be helping to write the chat scripts.\n",

    "Crucially, these bots are meant to be useful out of the gate, ... they no longer need conversation as a crutch for mass adoption. Sure, Apple’s Siri knows how to break the ice with a few jokes, but it largely exists to help you get things done. Rival assistants from Google and Amazon don’t exhibit much personality at all. Utility is winning out because the technology allows for it.\n",

    "\n",
    "As an aside, Weizenbaum didn't create ELIZA as a state of the art conversational program. He was, in fact, troubled by its positive reception, and later in life he wrote about the limits of artificial intelligence.
