    "There are **so** many questions that revolve around this particular feature available to users on most social networks today, that it would be hard to cover everything in a single class. However, we will do our best to discuss the relevant parts and defer the rest of the material via readings outside class. Main points from these reading materials will be explored further in [discussion sessions](#Discussion).\n",

    "> We will start with some [introductory](#Introduction) questions that focus on how and where trends come from? Or who decides what's on the trending topic list? Can they really be considered **a signal for \"attention\"** on social media platforms? It is important to understand these factors before we embark on parsing and finding patterns in data about computed trends from Facebook or Twitter. This is fundamental to any data science analysis - the incentives and procedures through which the data source generates and publishes data can often give us significant knowledge about how to interrogate it. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Following that, we will explore some real [datasets](#Data) of trends collected from Facebook and Twitter. This will give you hands-on experience analyzing trends, assessing their patterns and rhythms. On Thursday, we will flip things around and you will be asked to come up with trending algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The next section will be [methods](#Methods), where we will study some metrics that help **quantify features in the trend signal**. Example features include how long a trend lasted in some location, or how many geolocations it spread to etc. Note it isn't necessary that these features will reveal something \"interesting\" about the trend. The idea of this exercise is to help you calibrate your thinking about trends as a signal of social attention. In other words, assuming trends were a signal of \"attention\", what metrics can be used to compare to trends? \n",
    "\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start this session with some web work and a discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The idea of a trending or popular topic has become a fixture of the web and almost a navigational strategy for many of us. But what does it mean for a topic to be trending? How do these notions relate to other uses of the word, say from fashion? Next, let's find situations where trends are published, and talk about what they mean. What's trending on these sites?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, let's focus just on Twitter and Facebook. What are the differences between their ideas of what's trending? What are your options for exploring trends on each platform? What comparisons can you make and what changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a broad sense, the idea behind trending topics is to surface something that signifies what the community is interested in, or paying attention to. Thus, when a group of users on Twitter increasingly RT (Retweet) a message or tweet about some topic, Twitter labels this as a \"trend\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the incredible amounts of user-generated messages that these social platforms see everyday, Trending Topics are usually determined by an \"algorithm\" (a computer program or a set of guidelines for humans to follow... or a mixture). The role of the algorithm is to collect a substantial chunk of data generated on the social media site and strive to find **words/or phrases that occur more frequently than others, or words that are being produced with high \"velocity\"**.

    "### 1.1 Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Trending algorithms often begin by creating a **sample** of tweets or FB status messages. Why do we want to work with  a subset of these messages, why not the whole thing you ask? Well, for one, the data might simply be too big to analyze quickly. In this case, some form of random sampling would help reduce the size of the data, but hopefully preserve the important patterns. Twitter, for example, offers users a random sample of tweets from their API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, depending on your notion of a trend, we might want to identify patterns in certain cohorts/groups/communities within a social network. This means creating a sample of data from just these members, possibly using statistical sampling again if the number is too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "So sampling, being the first phase of the trend algorithm, plays a critical role in what trends are surfaced. For example, if you sample all Facebook messages originating from India vs. those originating from the USA, then there is bound to be significant difference in the trending topic list, because the status updates would probably be different. This is true unless there is a global event that captures the attention of both nations simulateneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which sample you choose really goes back to your goals for computing a trending topic in the first place? What do you intend or what do your readers expect?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Twitter and Facebook personalize trends based on many signals. The main signals include: \n",
    "* (1) Your interests: Pages you follow or things you LIKE.  \n",
    "* (2) People in your social network, and\n",
    "* (3) Your location: Twitter provides trends in more than 400 geolocations world wide. Facebook collects trends in only 5 zones, namely CA, IN, US, GB and AU. \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter calls this sort of personalization \"Tailored Trends\" which is on by default, although you can click on \"change\" and retrieve trending topics for ANY geolocation. The Facebook trending list is personalized by default as well, but more importantly it is *not possible* to retrieve the global list of trends for any Facebook zone in Facebook's UI. Meaning on Twitter, you can see whats trending in Paris even if you live in Boston. On Facebook, you cannot see what's trending in Australia unless you live there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, our APIs have the ability to extrat the global list of Facebook trends from all its 5 zones. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Trend Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "So the next obvious question is: why does a trend start in one place and spread all over the network? To understand this, we must delve a bit deeper. A sequence of activity resembles what we call time series data. Activity in a social network can be tracked in three levels: (1) Micro, (2) Meso and (3) Macro. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Micro: You tweet or RT something\n",
    "* Meso: All the people in Washington DC tweet/RT something\n",
    "* Macro: The entire network activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Meso signals resemble time series data generated from activity of a collection of users. We do not know exactly how such activity correlates with one other, but most previous research hint at information cascades as one reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information cascades** resemble a mathematical system where each node will make a decision of whether to forward the message/information or not based on its previous experience (is this a influential person) and the current signal information (is this tweet good enough to RT). In general, the *n*th agent considers the decisions of the previous *n-1* agents, and his/her own signal. He/she then makes a decision based on some reasoning to determine the most rational choice. The result is a set of activities on information propagating from node to node. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7988kEm4d2hDZdCpQoMGiQ.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Because meso signals are generated from micro signal (individual) activity and individual activity is influenced by network topology (who you follow and who follows you), the trend signal is indirectly caused by information dynamics governed by network topology. "

    "### 1.4 The Attention Signal\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the **trending topic over time is a SIGNAL** - a signal for what has captured the attention of a particular demographic (i.e. in a geo-location or within a community). Plotting such topic signals can often reveal interesting facts about information diffusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets look at the trending topic '#Ferguson' in various US cities. \n",
